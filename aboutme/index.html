        <p> Hi class, I am a business management major. I am doing this class to get a certification in web and computer programming. 
        Also, to see if I would like to continue in computer science courses. 
        Some of my hobbies are going to workout at the gym, hiking, swimming, and unfortunantly eating. That last part kind
        of nullifies the previouse three activites. Still working on that for the New Year.</p>
        <P> My wife and I have been married for ten years and have no kids. We are actively and patiently waiting for That
        blessing to come in our lives. However, we are kept busy with our nieces and nephews.</P>
        <P> I currently work for the city I live in. I'm thinking that accomplishing my degree and certification will make
        me more marketable in my company and the workforce in general.</P>
